	<h1>Image Generator</h1>
	
	<p>November 2nd, 2013 -- Spencer T. Parkin</p>
	
	<p>This page documents the Image Generator program and its results.  As I'm sure you can easily guess,
	this program is designed to facilitate the generation of images.  It is designed to
	do so on a per-pixel basis.  Exactly what image gets generated is abstracted away by
	the concept of an image generator plug-in.  As of this writing, two exist as members
	of the project.  The first generates Mandelbrot fractals, the second is a ray-tracer.</p>
	
	<p>The problem of generating images in this manner lends itself well to the prospect of
	distributing the work-load of filling in the image over multiple threads of execution.
	Indeed, this was the goal for the image generator framework upon which image generator
	plug-ins are built.  Once an image generator plug-in is loaded and ready to go, you can configure the
	number of threads over which the image generator program will distribute the work-load
	of calculating the image.  For each pixel, the question of what color that
	pixel should be is deferred to the currently loaded plug-in, which, of course, must of necessity take
	thread-safety concerns into account in the process of determining the answer.</p>
  
    <h2>The Ray Tracer Plug-in</h2>
	
	<p>The ray tracing image generator plug-in was my first attempt to implement a ray-tracer.
	If there is any originality in this program, it can only be found in its implementation,
	as the concepts, algorithms, data-structures and illumination equations were all taken
	from the well-known book "Computer Graphics, Principles and Practice", by Foley, van Dam, et. al.
	Some intuition was needed to fill the gaps in my understanding of the illumination models
	found in this book, in which case, you might say that there is a bit of originality in the
	resulting images.  In any case, I have, so far, been very pleased with the results of the
	program, and, admittedly, didn't think that the images could come out looking as realistic
	as they do.  There may be subtle mistakes discernible within the generated images, but if
	there are, it is not entirely obvious to me.  At the following link, you can view some of
	the images generated by this plug-in.

	<p>Writing this program has cleared up a misconception I had about ray tracers.
	I had erroneously thought that, given an infinite amount of computer memory, and time,
	that a ray tracer could generate an image to a sufficient resolution that it may well
	be considered as realistic as what the natural eye can see.  This is not so.  As a
	visible surface determination algorithm, the ray tracing algorithm is correct, but
	when it comes to determining all sources of light and shadow, the ray-tracing algorithm
	falls quite short of this non-trivial problem.
	</p>
	
	<p>Here is quick explanation as to why this is the case.  Consider first a surface point
	lit by a near-by light source.  How did the light from this source reach
	the surface point?  There are an enumerable number of possibilities.  To make things
	simple, we often pretend that there are no obstructions that could have potentially
	refracted the light or otherwise modified its path on its way to the surface point.
	In such cases, what we get is indirect lighting.  The consequence of this idea is the
	potential for almost any object in the scene to be a source of light.  Objects being
	non-trivially shaped in comparison to a point-light, (a point-light being shaped as, well,
	a single point in space), we now introduce the complexity of umbras and penumbras!</p>
	
	<p>
	Supposedly, the ultimate solution to these conundrums is the idea of forward ray tracing.
	With such tracing, instead of tracing light from the eye to the light sources, we, more
	naturally, I suppose, trace all light from its various sources, to the eye.  Of course,
	this becomes completely impractical when we realize that we can't possible limit our
	consideration of light-rays to only those that will actually reach the eye.  Without doing
	so, there are just too many light-rays to trace to make this approach feasible.
