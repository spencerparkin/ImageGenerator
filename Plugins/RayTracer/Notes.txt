I believe that there is something wrong with the view projection rays, because
sphere appear warped that are not front and center.

I should probably re-implement the sphere-to-ray intersection test using traditional
methods, because this may be the reason why I can't generate shadows with point-lights.
In any case, there is something wrong with point-light shadow generation, and I don't
know what it is yet.
