TODO: I think there's a bug in the refraction code.  I need to know which side of a surface that a given ray is on so that
      I use the correct indices of refraction in the right places in the refractance vector calculation equation.
      This is hard, because I need to know whether the ray is "inside" or "outside" a surface, and knowing that requires
      knowing something about the topology of the surface, unless we assume that we go from one to the other and start outside.
      A plane, for example, has no inside or outside.  But a sphere does.

-- Implement soft shadows.
-- Get refraction working.
-- Implement texturing.
-- Get specular highlights working.
